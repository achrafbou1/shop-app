# shop-app

Run 'npm install' followed by 'node server.js' or 'nodemon server.js' to start the app.

I used mLab to store my database and collections ('user' and 'shops' collection).

I've completed all requirements (+ optionals) except for "[Optional] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours". The disliked shop won't be displayed for the next 2 hours as long as the user stays on the same page, if the page is refreshed the shop reappears again.

I mainly used Nodejs, Expressjs, Passportjs, AJAX, Bootstrap, EJS and MongoDB to build the app.
